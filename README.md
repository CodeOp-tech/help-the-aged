# Help The Aged

## Introduction

Create an app for elderly / care homes to find local volunteer help

Ideally, we would like an interactive map where you can browse people needing help / people offering help locally.

We will focus on creating the user experience for people offering their help.

## Steps & Functionalities

- Database
Create a database with entries from Helper's profile (needs to include Postcode)

- Homepage
Present what the project is and how it works
Includes a carousel with pictures of different services Helpers can offer
Includes a form to join and post an ad as a local helper that will render on the map
